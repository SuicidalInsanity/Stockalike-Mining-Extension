title = 'Terravore' Stack Mining Excavator
manufacturer = Coreworks Extractions Consortium
description = A large scale ventral mount heavy mining excavator designed to extract usable materials from asteriods and planetary regolith. When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating. Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat. 13.33 times more efficient than the stock radial drill.
