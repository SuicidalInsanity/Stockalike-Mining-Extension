description = A compact mining drill designed to extract usable materials from asteriods and planetary regolith. When not deployed, it fits within a mk2 fuselage compatible aeroshell housing. When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat. Yields 2/3s as much Ore/s as the stock Radial Drill.
