description = A smaller version of Kerbodyne's mobile processing plant, this module can take raw materials containing even trace amounts of oxygen and hydrogen, and crack them into useful fuel products.  When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  This model, while lacking the power of its bigger brother, is still capable of full ore conversion options, unlike the smaller 125 model. This module operates best at its ideal operating temperature, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.
